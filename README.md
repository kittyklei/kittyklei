- Hi, I'm Lynx (18, it/he/she)! I'm very much new to coding besides surface-level topics. I'm intermediate when it comes to HTML and CSS but am trying to learn about using the terminal and git.
- Besides that, I'm looking into JS to learn a new language and go deeper into front-end webdev.
- You can email me at kleiman@kittymail.com or add me on Discord @kittyraver.
